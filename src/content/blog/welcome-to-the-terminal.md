# Welcome to the Terminal

> System initialized. Connection established.

Welcome to our cyberpunk terminal interface - a throwback to the golden age of command-line interfaces, reimagined for the modern web.

## Why Terminal Aesthetics?

The terminal interface represents pure, unfiltered interaction with technology. No distractions, no unnecessary chrome - just you and the machine communicating in the most direct way possible.

### Key Features

▸ **Monospace Typography** - Every character aligned perfectly
▸ **Neon Accents** - Cyan and magenta highlights that pop
▸ **ASCII Art** - Classic box-drawing characters for authentic feel
▸ **60fps Effects** - CSS-only animations for smooth performance

## Design Philosophy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Form follows function              │
│  Simplicity over complexity         │
│  Performance is a feature           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

We built this interface to strip away the noise and focus on what matters: content, speed, and clarity.

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to expand our terminal universe. The future is retro, and we're just getting started.
